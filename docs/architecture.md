# Architecture

PR Nutrition follows a deterministic local pipeline:

```text
Git metadata
  -> file classification
  -> repository evidence
  -> risk scoring
  -> AnalysisResult
  -> Markdown/JSON renderers
  -> CLI or read-only GitHub Action
```

## Package Boundaries

- `packages/core`: Owns the analysis engine and renderers. Contains no GitHub Action or CLI parsing logic.
- `packages/cli`: Only handles arguments, output writing, and exit codes. Uses `packages/core`.
- `packages/action`: A read-only GitHub Action wrapper around the core, without changing the core model or calling GitHub APIs.

## Stable Core Boundary

`analyzePullRequest()` returns a versioned `AnalysisResult`. Changed areas are an ordered array with an identifier, label, and matching file paths. Risk reasons, review focus, explanations, and focus-file groups follow fixed deterministic order. `renderMarkdown()` and `renderJson()` are pure transformations of that result.

The core invokes Git directly, without a shell, and requests metadata only. Strict config validation, deterministic path classification, and doctor diagnostics stay local. GitHub API access, AST parsing, hosted services, and LLM services are outside the current trusted core boundary.

## GitHub Action Boundary

`packages/action` owns only runner-specific behavior:

- reading Action inputs
- reading pull-request base/head SHAs from the GitHub event payload
- requiring callers to provide full history with `actions/checkout` and `fetch-depth: 0`
- writing Markdown and JSON report files
- appending Markdown to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
- setting Action outputs

The Action does not fetch Git history, call GitHub APIs, post comments, mutate pull requests, or add write-permission requirements. It should remain a distribution wrapper for the same deterministic core report, not a separate review platform.
