## Project overview

PR Nutrition is a deterministic-first CLI and GitHub Action that generates a review-readiness label for pull requests.

The tool should tell reviewers:

- what changed
- what looks risky
- what evidence exists
- which files are likely generated or low-review-value
- where reviewers should focus first

This is not an AI code reviewer. The core product should be explainable, local-first, and rule-based. Optional LLM support may be added later only for wording or polish, not for deciding risk.

## Current product direction

PR Nutrition should remain a local-first PR triage CLI first, with the GitHub Action as an optional read-only wrapper for CI summaries and outputs. The strongest use case is: before reviewing, submitting, or pushing a PR, tell the author or reviewer what matters.

Build in this order:

1. Core diff analyzer
2. Path and risk classifier
3. Markdown renderer
4. CLI package
5. Test fixtures
6. GitHub Action wrapper
7. Config file support
8. False-positive evaluation suite
9. CLI explain/focus/doctor workflows
10. Optional LLM polish
11. PR split hints

After the read-only Action, prefer CLI trust and accuracy improvements before integrations that create notifications. Do not add a config parser, GitHub API client, LLM client, AST parser, database, web UI, inline review comments, or write permissions unless the user explicitly scopes that milestone.

## Tech stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js 22.13 or newer, below Node 27
- pnpm 11.8.0
- Vitest for tests
- tsup for builds
- GitHub Actions for CI

Prefer small packages and minimal dependencies.

## Architecture rules

- `packages/core`: diff parsing, classification, risk scoring, and output model
- `packages/cli`: command-line interface
- `packages/action`: read-only GitHub Action wrapper around the core
- `examples`: demo repositories and sample outputs
- `docs`: design notes and contributor documentation

The core package must not depend on GitHub APIs. GitHub Action-specific input, event, step summary, and output-file logic belongs in `packages/action`.

## Coding rules

- Keep functions small and testable.
- Prefer deterministic rules over LLM calls.
- Do not hardcode one framework unless necessary.
- Avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Explain any new large dependency before adding it.
- Add or update tests for every detector or rule.
- Keep output stable with golden tests.

## Testing commands

Before finishing code changes, run:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
pnpm eval
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm action:bundle-check
pnpm build
pnpm smoke
pnpm release:check
```

## Security and privacy rules

- Never send source code to an external API by default.
- Do not read `.env` files except to detect their presence by path.
- Do not print secrets, tokens, or private environment values.
- Treat PR diffs as sensitive user data.
- LLM features must be opt-in.
- Do not execute repository scripts while analyzing a pull request.
- Do not use Git commands that print patch contents.

## PR rules

Every PR should include:

- what changed
- why it changed
- how it was tested
- sample PR Nutrition output when relevant

Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, and `refactor:`.

Strict naming and authoring rules:
- Branch and PR names must be normal and descriptive. Do NOT use the names of AI coding agents (e.g., Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) in branch names or PR titles.
- Do not use co-authoring (e.g., `Co-authored-by`) for AI coding agents.

## Product principle

The value of this project is trust. Prefer boring, explainable, useful output over flashy AI behavior.

PR Nutrition should never create work for reviewers. It should remove review noise before the review starts.
